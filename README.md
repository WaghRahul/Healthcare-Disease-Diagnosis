# Healthcare Disease Diagnosis Project

***Description:*** The "Healthcare Disease Diagnosis" project leverages machine learning to diagnose diseases based on patient symptoms and medical history. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset with information on symptoms (fever, cough, fatigue, difficulty breathing), patient demographics (age, gender), and medical metrics (blood pressure, cholesterol level), the project aims to enhance diagnostic accuracy.

***Key Techniques:***
- **Data Preprocessing:** Removing duplicates, encoding categorical data, and transforming data into numerical format.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing data with count plots, scatter plots, histograms, and pie charts.
- **Machine Learning:** Training a Random Forest Classifier to predict disease outcomes.

***Outcome:*** Provides a tool for healthcare professionals to diagnose diseases more accurately and efficiently.

***Keywords:*** Machine Learning, Data Preprocessing, Exploratory Data Analysis, Random Forest Classifier, Healthcare, Disease Diagnosis, Python.
