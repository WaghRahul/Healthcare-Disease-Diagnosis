# Healthcare-Disease-Diagnosis

Description:- The project "Healthcare Disease Diagnosis" aims to diagnose diseases based on patient symptoms and medical history. The dataset used in the project contains information on various diseases, including the name of the disease, patient symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, and difficulty breathing, patient age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol level, and the result of the diagnosis. The project uses data preprocessing techniques such as removing duplicates, encoding categorical data, and transforming categorical data into numerical format. The project also includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques such as count plots, scatter plots, histograms, and pie charts to visualize the data. The project uses machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest Classifier to predict the outcome variable. The project aims to provide a tool for healthcare professionals to diagnose diseases accurately and efficiently.
